This tool forward a purge request received to a pool of varnish connected via the reverse cli

Usage
=====

```
Usage of purgerd:
  -i="0.0.0.0:8111": socket where purge messages are sent, '0.0.0.0:8111'
  -o="0.0.0.0:1118": listening socket where purge message are sent to varnish reverse cli, 0.0.0.0:1118
  -p=false: purge all the varnish cache on connection
  -s="": path of the file containing the varnish secret
  -v=false: display version
```

Run purgerd from $GOCODE/bin/purgerd. With no options it will listen to purge requests on 0.0.0.0:8111.

Start varnish with the -M option to make it connect to the purger. (ex: -M localhost:1118 if you're running varnish on the same box)

If your varnish cli needs [authentication](https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/CLI#Authentication:Thegorydetails) pass the password with -s
